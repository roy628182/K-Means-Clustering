# K-Means-Clustering
A repository for implementing and exploring K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

- Implementations of K-Means Clustering in Python using Scikit-learn and NumPy
- Examples of using K-Means Clustering for image segmentation, customer segmentation, and gene expression analysis
- Code for visualizing clusters using matplotlib and seaborn
- Comparison of K-Means Clustering with other clustering algorithms, such as Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN
